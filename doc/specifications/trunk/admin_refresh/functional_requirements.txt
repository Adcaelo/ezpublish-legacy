Preface
-------
Current admin design, both in its styling and in its UI has been increasingly
subject to criticism for being outdated, slow, impossible to extend cleanly,
unintuitive and a lack of a central place to get a overview of all the task a user
(both editor and admin) needs to look after.

Overall there is a need to update the admin interface to adhere more closely to how web
applications have evolved with the improved usability, simplified interfaces, ajaxified
features and clean designs that users are becoming used to in the web 2.0 era.

For the out dated part, this comes down to over styled design compared to other admin interfaces.
Both in overwhelming the user with options to click, to much screen real-estate wasted on
styling and a out dated styling.

For slowness, this is first and foremost number of clicks and page refreshes you have
to go true to accomplish some key tasks. Identified key tasks are:
* Class attribute moving + adding + removing
* Adding policies to roles
* Finding relations on object relation and object relation list object attributes
* Browsing for nodes during actions like: move to, copy to, relations, assign role
   and add node / sub tree function limitations to policies

Extendability is defined as possibility for extensions to extend the admin interface
without having to override template files, as it then would be impossible for several
extensions to extend the same parts.

Making the interface more intuitive involves improving usability and removing / moving
/ hiding features that users does not need during the operation they are performing.
Identified tasks:
* Hide right menu by default
* Have separate preferences for media tab / pr tab for admin_children_view mode
  (user preferences for the sub items in admin)
* Move actions from context menu's to a more accessible place in the interface

A overview of user task need a dashboard, where she can follow here own
content, approval and other tasks she might do on a regular basis.
