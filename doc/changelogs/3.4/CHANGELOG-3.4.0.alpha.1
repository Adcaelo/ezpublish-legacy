- Added wildcard search to eZSearchPlugin. This feature is disabled by
  default, but can be enabled in site.ini->SearchSettings->EnableWildcard.
- Added edit button link for class view.
- Added support for fetching a class by the identifier
  (fetchByIdentifier) eZContentClass.
- Added support for class identifiers in addition to the existing class ids in
  content/action. Use ClassIdentifier instead of ClassID to get
  this functionality.
- New fetch function in content module for checking access types on an object
  called access.
- Added support for the new variable system in the URLs for google.tpl, that
  means (offset)/10 instead of offset/10, this also works with nice urls.
- Added class_identifier as design/override key to content/view.
- Added data_map support for eZContentClass, this means that all attributes are returned as an
  associative array with the identifier as the key.
- Added support for sending the class identifier as a string to the content/class fetch function.

*DataType:
- New function hasObjectAttributeContent (attribute.has_content in template)
  which returns true if the attribute is to be considered to have any content.
- Fixed a define typo in ezurltype.php

eZObjectRelation:
- Added support for choosing relation in a dropdown (combobox) where items
  are taken from a specific folder (list or tree)
- Added support for text field when having dropdown, the text field will allow
  for fuzzy matches with the names in the dropdown.

*Libraries:

eZ ini:
- Optimized storing of .ini file cache to use about 1/3 less memory when loading cached .ini files

eZ template:
- Some changes to the compiled templates.
  Removed the references when accessing attributes which fixed some of the problems with the image system.
  Use clearcache --clear-tpl after upgrading to be 100% sure they are recreated.
  Merged in from 3.3 stable (Rev. 4815).
