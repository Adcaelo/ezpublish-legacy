Changes from 3.4.3 to 3.4.4

*Kernel:

*Bugfixes:
- Fixed bug: Broken datatype
  (Merged from 3.3, rev. 9321)
  http://ez.no/community/bug_reports/broken_datatype.
- Fixed bug: http://ez.no/community/bug_reports/identifier_datatype
- Fixed bug:
  http://ez.no/community/bug_reports/fatal_error_in_ezpackagetype_php
  http://ez.no/community/bug_reports/look_feel_fatal_error_ezpackagetype_php_line_165
  http://ez.no/community/bug_reports/setup_look_feel_appearance_dissappeared
  These three are the same bug. Symptoms: When editing "Look and feel" in admin, you get a
  "fatal error" in kernel/classes/datatypes/ezpackage/ezpackagetype.php on line 165, or
  the "Appearance" thumbnails and radiobuttons disappears from the page. The bug also causes
  a database corruption. To fix it, edit the "Template look" class and store it without
  changing anything.

*Library:

eZDebug:
- Fixed output of arrays and objects to use PHP function var_export if it is
  available.
  (Merged from stable/3.3 (3.3-7) rev. 9331)

eZTemplate:
- Added scope support to the "set" template function. Scope can be global, root or relative (default).
  Also added unit tests for this.
