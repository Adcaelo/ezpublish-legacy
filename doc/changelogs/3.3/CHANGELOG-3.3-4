Changes from 3.3-3 to 3.3-4

*Kernel:
- Changed rendering of literal inside XML text to block to ensure correct XHTML validation
- Added boolean parameter 'main_node_only' in fetch function list, list_count, 
  tree and tree_count. The default is set to true. This can avoid obtaining duplicate 
  objects when fetch trees or lists with objects assigned to multiple locations.
- Fixed missing include to ezinformationcollection in ezcontentfunctioncollection.php

*Setup:

*DataTypes:
- Fixed datatype inisetting which can't save parameter value like "x=y";

  used unchecked causing a crash on the page.

*Library:
