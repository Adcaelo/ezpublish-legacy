Q: I just pasted in some javascript in my template, and suddenly nothing is
   shown correctly. What happened?

A: This is because our template engine treat the { and } characters as special
   characters and expects template specific code. You need to use the {literal}
   function to make sure the javascripts are parsed correctly. Place {literal}
   before the javascripts and {/literal} after.


Q: I get errormessages like : 
   Warning: Failed to write session data (user). Please verify that the
   current setting of session.save_path is correct (/tmp/) in Unknown on line 0

A: Try to apply the following in your php.ini file:
   session.auto_start = 0
