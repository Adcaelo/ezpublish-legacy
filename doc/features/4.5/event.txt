Event system
============

Intro
-----
This version includes a preview of a simple event(bus) / hook system.

The background for adding it is to have a uniformed extension point in the
kernel for places where extensions needs to be notified about certain actions.
And in some cases be able to manipulate that specific action.
This is also needed to be able to cleanup our kernel and move things like shop out
into extensions.

This system overlaps slightly with our current trigger/operations system, but is
much lighter. The general idea is that our workflow system at some point should be
replaced by a full blown workflow system like ezcWorkflow, and hence will not any longer
be suited as a event bus system for inter kernel components / extension notifications.


How to use: Globally
--------------------
To listen to events globally, ini settings is used.

The ini setting used is site.ini/[Event]/CallbackList[] and doc on use can be found there.


How to use: Lazy load
---------------------
Note: Api is placed in kernel/private, meaning it is not a public api and can be changed at anytime!

{@see ezpEvent::subscribe()}



Signature of events
-------------------
Note: Since this feature is private api, these can change at anytime.

request/input       ( eZURI $uri )
response/output     ( string &$templateResult )

session/cleanup     ()
session/destroy     ( string $sessionId )
session/regenerate  ( string $oldSessionId, string $sessionId )
session/gc          ( int $maxLifeTime )
