*Title: Advanced redirection after user/login.

*Incentive:

Currently, the redirect after login is set to the site root (or 
hardcoded from the login template). This is not very useful for sites 
with advanced permissions where some users can access parts of the site 
and others can access only other parts of the site. What we need is a 
system that allows the administrators to set up where users are 
redirected after login.

*Documentation:

Redirection URI can now be specified either per-user or per-group via 
additional attribute of type 'Text line'.

If a user is member of several groups (= is a child of several
'User group' nodes), "main" group (= main parent node) is
preferred.

Two new INI settings have been added to site.ini:
[UserSettings]
LoginRedirectionUriAttribute[user]=<attribute_identifier>
LoginRedirectionUriAttribute[group]=<attribute_identifier>

The first one specifies which attribute of class 'User' contains
redirection URI for the user.

The second one specifies which attribute of class 'User group' contains
redirection URI for members the group.

Note: It is not mandatory for the classes to be 'User' or 'User group'.
The first class should just contain an attribute of type 'User account'.
The second class is just a class that is able to have children.

*New settings:

site.ini :: [UserSettings] :: LoginRedirectionUriAttribute

*Example:

To specify a "home page" for user Fred, you should perform the following steps:
1. Add a 'Text line' attribute to class 'User', name it 'Redirection URI'.
   The new attribute gets identifier 'redirection_uri'.
2. Edit your site.ini.append:
   [UserSettings]
   LoginRedirectionUriAttribute[user]=redirection_uri
3. Edit user Fred, put "/media" to the 'Redirection URI' field.

That's it.
Since now, user Fred will be always redirected to the Media folder after login.
You can specify redirection URI for a group in a similar way.
