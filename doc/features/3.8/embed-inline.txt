*Title: New eZXML tag <embed-inline/>.

*Description:

"embed-inline" tag is an analog of the "embed" tag. Differences are described
below:

- "embed" tag is block tag, but "embed-inline" is inline. This means that
  templates for "embed-inline" can't contain block tags, but only tags
  that can be placed within paragraphs. "embed" tags are rendered
  outside paragraphs in the output, so they can contain block tags.
  
- By default "embed" tag renders objects using "embed" view of the content module.
  "embed-inline" tag renders objects using "embed-inline" view. You should have
  this in mind while making template overrides.
  
- Use "embed-inline" if you want to insert an image inside the text line, but use
  "embed" if you want to insert it between text paragraphs.


*Documentation:

All parameters of "embed-inline" tag are equivalent to those of "embed" tag.
