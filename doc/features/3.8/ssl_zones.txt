*Title: SSL Zones.

*Incentive:

It might be needed to force access over SSL to certain site parts.
Such parts are called "SSL zones".

*Documentation:

SSL zone might be:
1. a content subtree (content SSL zone);
2. a module view.

In the first case all the operations (viewing, editing, creating child
nodes) on nodes belonging to the subtree are done over SSL.

When a user leaves an SSL zone (i.e. when  he/she is accessing a subtree
or module view that does not belong to any SSL zone), the user is
automatically switched back to plain HTTP (without SSL).

*Configuration:

### site.ini.append ###

[SiteSettings]
SSLPort=8443

[SSLZoneSettings]
# Enable/disable the SSL zones functionality.
SSLZones=enabled

# It's up to these views to choose the appropriate access mode (http or https).
SmartViews=content/view;content/edit

# Content subtrees we must use SSL for.
SSLSubtrees[]
SSLSubtrees[]=/news
SSLSubtrees[]=/polls

# Default access mode is plain HTTP.
# It's possible to override access mode for specific views.
# If a view is defined as 'ssl' then HTTPS access mode is forced for this view.
# if a view is defined as 'keep' then no access mode change
# is allowed for this view, i.e. current access mode is kept.
ModuleViewAccessMode[shop/add]=ssl
ModuleViewAccessMode[shop/basket]=ssl
ModuleViewAccessMode[content/action]=keep
ModuleViewAccessMode[content/removeeditversion]=keep
