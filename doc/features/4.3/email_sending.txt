Email sending improvements
==========================

DebugSending
------------

When this is enabled (in [MailSettings] in site.ini) then no mails will be
sent to the intended recipients. Instead they will be sent to the address in
the DebugReceiverEmail setting. This is useful for example when working on a
test server that contains a copy of the production database. You can test mail
sending without worrying about test emails being sent to your end users.

This feature applies to emails sent through the eZMail API. Mails sent using
PHPs mail() function, or other methods, will not be affected.
