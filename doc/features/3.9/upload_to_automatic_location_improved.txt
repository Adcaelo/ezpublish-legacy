*Title: Improved files uploading to automatically choosen location.

*Documentation:

There is a setting that allows to set rules for automatic location selection
when uploading files (for example in the "Insert object" dialog of Online Editor).

content.ini:[RelationAssignmentSettings].ClassSpecificAssignment

Each line of this array contain class identifier and locations list.
(see content.ini comments for details)

From version 3.9 it is possible to specify the same class name in more than one line.
In this case that match will be selected where user has 'create' access rights in
all the locations.

*Example:

Let's say some user has no access to the folder 'media/images' but has access to
the folder 'media/myfolder'. In this case if he/she will upload an image, and
select "Automatic" value in the "Location" dropbox of the file upload dialog,
then a folder 'media/myfolder' will be automatically choosen.

ClassSpecificAssignment[]=image;media/myfolder
