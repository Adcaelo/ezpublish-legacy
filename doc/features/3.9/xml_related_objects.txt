*Title: Improvements to related objects added from XML block text field.

*Documentation:

There are 4 types of relations between objects in the system:

- 'Common'. Relations of common type are created when user adds related
objects manually.

- 'XML linked'. Relations of this type are added automatically when you
save object containing XML fields with <link> tags referencing objects or nodes
(ex: <link href='ezobject://123>... ). Note that when you remove <link> tag
and store object, the corresponding relation will be automatically removed.

- 'XML embedded'. Relations of this type are added automatically when you save
object containing XML fields with <embed> tags embedding objects or nodes.
Note that when you remove <embed> tag and store object, the corresponding
relation will be automatically removed.

- 'by Attribute'. Relations made by attributes of "Object relation" and
"Object relation list" datatypes.


*Template fetch functions:

The following fetch functions have been modified: related_objects,
related_objects_count, reverse_related_objects, reverse_related_objects_count.

Parameter 'all_relations' now has mixed type. It could be boolean true/false
like it was in 3.8, but it can be also an array. Array may consists of the
following strings: 'common', 'xml_link', 'xml_embed', 'attribute'. Each of
them mean corresponding relation type. Types can be mixed and placed in any
order. Also this new parameter is fully compatible with other options.
