*Title: Improvements to related objects added from XML block text field.

*Documentation:

Objects related on the object level (not by attribute) now have 3 types of relations:

- common (added manually by user)
- linked (added from <link> XML tag)
- embedded (added from <embed> XML tag)

Parameter 'relations_type' has been added to corresponding template fetch functions.
