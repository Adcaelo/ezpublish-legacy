*Title: Enhanced Object Relation datatype

*Original author: Xavier Dutoit

*Incentive:
The current datatypes are very limited.
New relation datatype should be more flexible. It must be possible to select specific classes and choose between
several ways of data editing (list, dropdown, own template).

*Documentation:
That's a mix between the default object relation (single relation, ala radio
button) and the object relation list datatypes (multiple relations, ala
check boxes). It provides the same functionalities, but store the relation
into the object relation table instead of into the object as an xml node and
support <b>multiple selections</b> and a more intuitive interface to select
the related objects (4 options to let your editor choose the related
objects).

Features
-----------
We have created an enhancedobjectrelation : 
- that stores the object relations as it is implemented on ez, therefore keeping all the nice features ez provides
  (eg list all the object related to aka reverse related),
- that is able to handle a one to one or one to many relationship,
- that let you define the target objects list based on their parent node.
- that provide two new interfaces two manage the relation: a list with radio button (single selection) 
and a list with check boxes (multiple selection)
- that allows you (based on the option you choose when you edit the class) to select one or multiple related objects.
- You can search the related objects (thx Gabriel Ambuhel),
- You can choose the related objects based on their class,
- You can choose the related objects based on their parent node,
- You can choose the related objects based on their parent node and their class (thx rudy demo)

If you need to store relations between objects and have a nicer interface than the 'browse' default solution,
this datatype might do it.
