*Title: Impoved 'content_structure_tree' operator

*Original author: Dirk Schmedding

*Documentation:
Currently the content_structure_tree template operator only supports one sort 
criteria. It is only possible to sort the entries by name OR by priority OR date.
The applied patch adds the possibiliy to sort by multiple sort criteria. The old
behaviour is still there, but instead setting a string, it is now possible to 
use an array with multiple sort criterias.
example:
{def  [...]
  $sort_by=array('priority/descending','name/ascending')
  $content_tree = content_structure_tree( 2, $class_filter, $max_depth, $max_nodes, $sort_by, $fetch_hidden ) }
[...]
