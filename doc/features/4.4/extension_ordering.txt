Extension ordering
==================

Intro
-----

In eZ Publish 4.4, there is a mechanism that enables extensions to define
in which order they should be loaded in regards to other, related, extensions.

Requirements
------------

For this mechanism to be active, extensions should be recent enough to contain
the needed metadata which are stored into a *loading.php* file contained at
the root directory of the extension.

Configuration
-------------

For the ordering to be active, the following configuration setting should be
enabled in *site.ini.append.php*:

::

    [ExtensionSettings]
    ExtensionOrdering=enabled
