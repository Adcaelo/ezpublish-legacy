Known bugs in eZ publish 3.0
----------------------------


Versioning
----------
Object relations are lost when reverting to another version of the object.
New versions are created as copies of the 1. version, should be the last(usable?) version.

Search
------
Too many database calls when indexing objects. Need to find the unique words
in PHP so that we will only index unique words.

זרו caracters do not work properly, we must also test russian and chinese. 
Probably the same error there.

Note: non-ASCII character support must be done with the i18n system.

Translate
---------
Complex data types, e.g. image, does not work when translating.

Translated objects are not indexed in search.


Validate
-------
Images are not uploaded if some attributes does not validate
(Maybe the fields which validate should be read and stored?)

View object with temporary class will show double of all attributes in list.
Due to temporary version of class which is joined in SQL.
(just join where version=0)

Enum datatype
-------------
It does not work to edit enum datatypes when there exists a temporary version
of the class.

the code for nvh detection needs to be redone.


Binary file upload
------------------
Must check if the file was too big. You should be able to
set the max filesize in the class edit.
