Known bugs in eZ publish 3.0
----------------------------

DEBUG
---------
Does not work with IP settings anymore.

http image post variables
-------------------------
We handle image post variables and buttons in the same way so that one can change the 
buttons to nice images.

Image (fixed)
---------
If no image is uploaded, image should not be shown. Now an invalid url is used
and you get broken image.

Versioning
----------
Object relations are lost when reverting to another version of the object.
New versions are created as copies of the 1. version, should be the last(usable?) version.

Edit
--------------
It is possible to add object to same node twice or more times
Search
------
Too many database calls when indexing objects. Need to find the unique words
in PHP so that we will only index unique words.

זר? caracters do not work properly, we must also test russian and chinese. 
Probably the same error there.

Note: non-ASCII character support must be done with the i18n system.

Translate
---------
Complex data types, e.g. image, does not work when translating.
Translated objects are not indexed in search.


Validate
-------
Images are not uploaded if some attributes does not validate
(Maybe the fields which validate should be read and stored?)

View object with temporary class will show double of all attributes in list.
Due to temporary version of class which is joined in SQL.
(just join where version=0)

Enum datatype (fixed)
-------------
It does not work to edit enum datatypes when there exists a temporary version
of the class.

eZ sys
________________
the code for nvh detection needs to be redone.


Forms
-----
When pressing enter ui forms is does not work. Because the name
of the button is checked. Workaround would be to create a hidden variable..
Is there a way to set default action/button when enter is pushed to submit a form?


Tasks
------------------------------------------
Error: error executing query: SELECT contentclass_id, contentclass_version, group_id, group_name
FROM   ezcontentclass_classgroup
WHERE  group_id IN ( '7' )  AND contentclass_version='0'
GROUP BY contentclass_id
ORDER BY contentclass_id ASC ERROR:  Attribute ezcontentclass_classgroup.contentclass_version must be GROUPed or used in an aggregate function
    on postgressql

Removing Objects
--------------------------------------
    It seems like when you remove objects his children are not deleted.
Fixed(sp)

Deprecated function in PHP 4.1.0
---------------------------------------------
call_user_method_array()
