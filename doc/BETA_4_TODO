Major code issues:
module.php:
- Better names for ViewList keys, params should parameters etc..
Actions:
- Make sure all views is moved away from postvariable checking and instead
  uses the action system and action parameters.
Template variables:
- Read only views should only pass as little as template variables as possible
  ie. just id's from input paramaters, it should be up to the template to fetch
  the actual objects and lists using the /fetch/ operator.
- Better names for template variables, for instance variables named attributes
  should be changed into attribute_list.
Path:
- Make sure all views has at least a simple path element.
- Figure out a way to allow templates to override path and other variables
  returned by a view. That way templates has even more control over the
  design.
Loops:
- Change all code that loops using:
reset( $list );
while ( ( $key = key( $list ) ) !== null )
{
  $item =& $list[$key];
  next( $list );
}

into

foreach ( array_keys( $list ) as $key )
{
  $item =& $list[$key];
}

Module:
- Do some changes the eZModule class, it should be created a eZModuleView class
  which will replace the $Module object in the views.
- Cleanup eZModule, there's some old code and variable names left there.
- Figure out if we need to move the class out of lib, or if we can move some of
  the specific code out of it.
Redirects:
- Change all redirect code to use redirectToView instead of redirectTo which
  requires the url to be created by the client, directToView takes care of this
  automatically.
Errors:
- Make sure input data is validated before using it, if they are invalid issue
  an error with handleError.
Functions:
- Implement more module functions, currently content is the only module which
  has defined any.
DataTypes:
- Create a system (perhaps in the eZDatatype class) which allows datatypes to
  fetch post variables without knowing that they are post variables.
Validators:
- The validator classes should not use regexs since they will not work properly
  with some charsets.
