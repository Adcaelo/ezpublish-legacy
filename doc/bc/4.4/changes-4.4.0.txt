Changes to BC and behavior  in version 4.3.0
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------




Change of behavior
-------------------

- Subversion revision number of eZ Publish is not accessible anymore.

  With the move to git, there is no such info anymore. This is not going to be
  replaced as the full version of eZ Publish is descriptive enough.

  Functions eZPublishSDK::revision() and eZSetupFunctionCollection::fetchRevision()
  has been removed as well as constants
  'VERSION_REVISION_STRING' and 'VERSION_REVISION' from class eZPublishSDK.

- Session does not start for anonymous users before it is needed

  Meaning if you use fetch function to get number of anonymous users it will not include anonymous
  users that have not gotten a session (this happens when she goes to things like user/register or content/edit)
  will not be included. LastAccessesURI / LastAccessedModifyingURI is also not stored before user gets a session.
  Set site.ini/Session.ForceStart to enabled to get old behavior.

- session_write_close()

  Because of above change in session behaviour, you should not call this function directly but instead
  use eZSession::stop() that have been available since 4.1.0. Ref http://issues.ez.no/017037

- Session handler uses native php handler by default (normally: file, this is defined in php.ini)

  This makes all fetch functions that is related to logged in users to not work, and it's not longer
  possible nor needed to clear/expire sessions from admin interface or command line interface.
  To get old behavoir back, enable db handler by setting site.ini/Session.Handler to eZSessionHandlerDB

- eZOperationHandler::operationIsAvailable()

  The $name parameter for this method is no longer optional. It did return false anyway if the parameter was omitted.

Deprecated functionality
------------------------

- eZTemplate->setVariableRef() functions

  This function has not set variables by reference since before
  4.0 (in php4 versions), hence it is now deprecated and setVariable()
  should be used instead.

- Third parameter ($attrs) on eZTemplate->hasVariable() and ->variable() functions

  This parameter where not used at all in the kernel and will be removed in a
  future versions.

- LastAccessesURI & LastAccessedModifyingURI session variables

  These variables represent state and should not use sessions*, we will migrate eZ Publish to
  use post parameters in the future, and we recommend you to do the same for your custom code.
  * breaks when you have multiple windows open, something power users frequently do.

* INI file suffix *.ini.php & *.ini.append

  This ini suffix types have been deprecated, please use *.ini or *.ini.append.php

Renamed methods
---------------

Removed features
----------------

- Template variable 'ezinfo' is not defined by default anymore. It used to
  contain keys: 'version', 'version_alias' and 'revision'.
  Those information may still be retrieved using eZPublishSDK's functions,
  except for the 'revision' key.

- Section ID no longer global

  Like other session related topics mentioned above, previous eZ Publish versions remembered section id state for
  use as override option on pages that had nothing to do with section (non content related) like user/login.
  This is no longer supported.

- Session Validation

  Session validation as added in 4.1 has been removed, this feature was flawed and caused issues in several cases.
  Only use case left where intranets, and there exist far better solutions for securing these (VPN / IP filtering).
  This means the following settings in site.ini\[Session] have been removed:
  SessionValidationIpParts, SessionValidationForwardedIpParts & SessionValidationUseUA

Removed methods
---------------

- eZCharTransform::varExportInternal()

  This private function was removed as it is not needed on php 5 and was not used anywhere.

Removed globals
---------------
