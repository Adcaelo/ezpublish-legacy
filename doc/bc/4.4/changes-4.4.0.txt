Changes to BC and behavior  in version 4.3.0
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------




Change of behavior
-------------------

- Subversion revision number of eZ Publish is not accessible anymore.

  With the move to git, there is no such info anymore. This is not going to be
  replaced as the full version of eZ Publish is descriptive enough.

  Functions eZPublishSDK::revision() and eZSetupFunctionCollection::fetchRevision()
  has been removed as well as constants
  'VERSION_REVISION_STRING' and 'VERSION_REVISION' from class eZPublishSDK.

- LastAccessesURI and LastAccessedModifyingURI will no longer be saved by default

  They can be enabled again by setting site.ini/Session.StoreLastAccessedURI to enabled.

- Session does not start for anonymous users before it is needed

  Meaning if you use fetch function to get number of anonymous users, it will not include anonymous
  users that have not gotten a session (this happens when she goes to things like user/register or content/edit)
  will not be included. Set site.ini/Session.ForceStart to enabled to get old behavior.
  (you also need to use DB session handler to get this to work, see bellow)

- Session handler uses native php handler by default (normally: file, this is defined in php.ini)

  This makes all fetch functions that is related to logged in users to not work, and it's not longer
  possible nor needed to clear/expire sessions from admin interface or command line interface.
  To get old behavoir back, enable db handler by setting site.ini/Session.Handler to eZSessionHandlerDB

- Section ID no longer global

  Like other session related topic mentioned above, prevous eZ Publish versions remembered section id state for
  use as override option on pages that had nothing to do with section (non content related) like user/login.
  This is no longer supported. 

Deprecated functionality
------------------------

- eZTemplate->setVariableRef() functions have been deprecated
  This function has not set variables by reference since before
  4.0 (in php4 versions), hence it is now deprecated and setVariable()
  should be used instead.

- Third parameter ($attrs) on eZTemplate->hasVariable() and ->variable() functions
  have been deprecated.
  This parameter where not used at all in the kernel and will be removed in a
  future versions.


Renamed methods
---------------

Removed features
----------------

- Template variable 'ezinfo' is not defined by default anymore. It used to
  contain keys: 'version', 'version_alias' and 'revision'.
  Those information may still be retrieved using eZPublishSDK's functions,
  except for the 'revision' key.
