Changes to BC and behavior  in version 4.3.0
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------




Change of behavior 
-------------------

- Subversion revision number of eZ Publish is not accessible anymore.

  With the move to git, there is no such info anymore. This is not going to be
  replaced as the full version of eZ Publish is descriptive enough.

  Functions eZPublishSDK::revision() and eZSetupFunctionCollection::fetchRevision()
  has been removed as well as constants
  'VERSION_REVISION_STRING' and 'VERSION_REVISION' from class eZPublishSDK.


Deprecated functionality
------------------------

- eZTemplate->setVariableRef() functions have been deprecated
  This function has not set variables by reference since before
  4.0 (in php4 versions), hence it is now deprecated and setVariable()
  should be used instead.

- Third parameter ($attrs) on eZTemplate->hasVariable() and ->variable() functions
  have been deprecated.
  This parameter where not used at all in the kernel and will be removed in a
  future versions.


Renamed methods
---------------

Removed features
----------------

- Template variable 'ezinfo' is not defined by default anymore. It used to
  contain keys: 'version', 'version_alias' and 'revision'.
  Those information may still be retrieved using eZPublishSDK's functions,
  except for the 'revision' key.
