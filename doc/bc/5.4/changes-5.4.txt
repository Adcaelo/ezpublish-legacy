Changes to BC and behavior in version 5.4
=========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------


Change of behavior
------------------

- EZP-23019 : date and datetime datatypes use NULL as empty value

  Both datatypes previously used 0 as their default value. This ensures that value does not fall back
  to 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Note that the sort default value is still 0 which can result in
  inconsistencies when trying to sort some objects with unset dates.

Removed features
----------------

- EZP-23082: completely remove ezsearch_return_count table

  The table ezsearch_return_count is not used by eZ Publish anymore, so simply remove it.
  This drastically decreases the size of the database for huge sites.


Removed constants
-----------------



Removed globals
---------------



Deprecated
