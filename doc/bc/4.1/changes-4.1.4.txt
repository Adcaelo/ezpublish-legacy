Changes to BC and behaviour in version 4.1.4
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

image.ini
  [AnimatedGIF]
  DisallowedFilters[] defaults to empty
  AllowedFilters[] defaults to geometry/*
  This change is to ensure that animated GIFs can be resized using default settings.
  Also implemented in 4.2.0 and 4.0.7.

- site.ini [MailSettings]TransportAlias

  Added the list of available mail transports, used by the class eZMailTransport
  to instantiate the transport class based on the setting [MailSettings]Transport
  when sending an email.


Renamed methods
---------------

- eZSoapRequest::namespace() -> eZSoapRequest::ns()

  Renamed for php 5.3 support, see issue #13825.


Removed globals
---------------

- eZMailTransport

  eZMailTransport does not use globals anymore.


Change of behaviour
-------------------

- Function loginUser() of eZUser doesn't use the email address for updating the hash

  Previously when updating the HashType in site.ini to md5_user, loginUser() was
  using the email address to store the hash. Now it uses the login column of
  the ezuser table instead.
