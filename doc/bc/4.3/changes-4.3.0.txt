============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------


Change of behavior 
-------------------

- Look & Feel url hardcoded in ini

  Because of enhancement  "#15672: Use ini setting for menu items in admin", url to
  Look and Feel object is defined in menu.ini[Leftmenu_design]Links[] using object
  id 54. If you have an old install this object id might be a different one and 
  you'll need to override the setting.
