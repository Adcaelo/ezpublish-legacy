Changes to BC and behavior  in version 4.3.0
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- Webshop tab hidden by default

  As a first step towards removing the shop functionality from the kernel and
  move it into an extension, we have now disabled this tab by default.
  You can re-enable it by adding Tabs[]=shop to menu.ini[TopAdminMenu]
  
- Design tab hidden by default

  All menu entries from design tab except Template, has been moved to setup tab.
  If you want to enable design tab and / or Template link, see menu.ini.

- site.ini[RSSSettings]DefaultVersion

  Changed default version from 1.0 to 2.0 as RSS 2.0 is the most widespread feed
  format, and the fact that it support images in the feed.


Change of behavior 
-------------------

- Look & Feel url hardcoded in ini

  Because of enhancement  "#15672: Use ini setting for menu items in admin", url to
  Look and Feel object is defined in menu.ini[Leftmenu_setup]Links[]
  ( and if you have re-enabled design tab also menu.ini[Leftmenu_design]Links[] )
  using object id 54. If you have an old install this object id might be a different one
  and you'll need to override the setting.
