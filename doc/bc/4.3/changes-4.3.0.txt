Changes to BC and behavior  in version 4.3.0
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- Webshop tab hidden by default

  As a first step towards removing the shop functionality from the kernel and
  move it into an extension, we have now disabled this tab by default.
  You can re-enable it by adding Tabs[]=shop to menu.ini[TopAdminMenu]
  
- Design tab hidden by default

  All menu entries from design tab except Template, has been moved to setup tab.
  If you want to enable design tab and / or Template link, see menu.ini.
  
- roles & policy link disabled in setup tab

  Since this link also present on User accounts tab, and belongs there. This link
  has been disabled on Setup tab in menu.ini under [Leftmenu_setup]

- site.ini[RSSSettings]DefaultVersion

  Changed default version from 1.0 to 2.0 as RSS 2.0 is the most widespread feed
  format, and the fact that it support images in the feed.

- design.ini [StylesheetSettings]CSSFileList

  Deprecated in favour of FrontendCSSFileList & BackendCSSFileList
  settings, will be removed in a future version (normally in two versions).

- design.ini [JavaScriptSettings]JavaScriptList

  Deprecated in favour of FrontendJavaScriptList & BackendJavaScriptList
  settings, will be removed in a future version (normally in two versions).


Change of behavior 
-------------------

- Look & Feel url hardcoded in ini

  Because of enhancement  "#15672: Use ini setting for menu items in admin", url to
  Look and Feel object is defined in menu.ini[Leftmenu_setup]Links[]
  ( and if you have re-enabled design tab also menu.ini[Leftmenu_design]Links[] )
  using object id 54. If you have an old install this object id might be a different one
  and you'll need to override the setting.

- eZTreeMenuOperator/ 'treemenu' does not return pre generated data_map

  Because of enhancement  "#3005: Increase performance eZTreeMenuOperator", data_map
  is no longer part of the hash-structure for each element, and you'll need to access
  it as normal using the node (so $item.node.data_map instead of $item.data_map ).

- eZDir::recursiveDelete() performs a new check by default

  The directory to be removed must be under the root directory of eZ Publish,
  unless the second parameter of the function is set to false. This is a
  safety measure introduced to solve: "#015823: Running cache clearing
  procedure from upgrade 4.2.0 using root removes all linux system files"
  

eZContentClass::instantiate() changes
-------------------------------------

- $userID now has to be false if you want to create objects for current user
  If you don't set it to false, new object id will no longer be stored in user
  session for use by policy system to let anonymous user re edit object. 


Deprecated methods
------------------

- ezi18n() and ezx18n() functions has been deprecated in favor of new
  ezpI18n::translate() function that takes advantage of autoloading so you don't need
  to requrie_once the i18n.php file. These two function will be removed in a future
  version.

- kernel/common/ezincludefunctions.php 
  All functions in this file has been deprecated, functions not already deprecated:
  kernel_include(), kernel_common(), datatype_class(), extension_path(),
  ext_include(), ext_activate(), ext_class(), lib_include(), lib_class() and kernel_class()
  These functions will be removed in a future version.
