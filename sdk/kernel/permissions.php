<p>
The restriction of what a user can do is handled by roles in eZ publish.
</p>

<h2>Role</h1>
<p>
Roles consist of a policy set, where each policy gives the user access to
a resource. Resources may be accessed in contect, e.g. you can read content in
section 42.
</p>

<p>
Roles is set up for the different roles users has on a site. E.g. you could
have visitor, journalist, editor and administrator. The different roles would
grant access to different resources.
</p>

<p>
Roles can be combined for simpler administration. E.g. you can have one role which
gives access to reading content and another role
</p>

<p>
A role can be assigned to any user or user group ( combinations may be used ).
</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>
A policy defines a certain resource. A policy defines a resource using the
following elements.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Module</li>
	<li>Function</li>
	<li>Parameter(s)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permission check</h2>
<p>
The first thing that needs to be done is to identify the user.
When you have a user id you will know which roles this user
has. From these roles you will get the permission list.
