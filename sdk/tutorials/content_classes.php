<h1>Custom Content</h1>

<p>
One of the most powerful features of eZ publish 3 is that you can define your own content classes.
A content class defines the structure of the content you want to publish on your site. Examples of
different content classes are; article, folder, image, product and link.
</p>

<h2>Creating classes</h2>

<p>
When you start to build your site you need to find the suitable structure for your content. eZ publish
comes with a set of standard content classes which you can use, but you will most likely need to create
your own custom classes for your specific needs.
</p>

<p>
Lets say we need to publish information about cars. We then need to create a class called car.
The class needs the attributes; Name, Manufacturer, Model, Year, Description and Image.
</p>

<p>
You will find the administration interface for classes under "Set up" in the eZ publish administration
interface. Then click on the apropriate group, e.g. content, where you want to place your class. The group
is just a method of categorizing your content classes for simpler administration of larger sites. Then you
click on the "New class" button. You will then be presented to the class edit window as shown below:
</p>
<img src="/doc/images/class_edit.jpg" alt="Class edit" border="1" />

<p>
Every class has 3 attributes; object name, identifier and name. The name is the alias for the class. The
identifier is a 0-9 a-z representation of the name, this is used in templates, import/exports etc as an
identifier for the class. The object name defines how an object of this class will be named. All objects
get a one-line name which can consist of several values. In this examples it will be the same as the first
attribute - name.
</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>
We then need to create the attributes for the car class. To add a new attribute you select the datatype
for the attribute in the dropdown in the lower right corner of the class edit page. Every attribute has a name
and an identifier. You only need to fill in the name, the identifier will automatically be generated.
Attributes are by default searchable, this means that the data entered here will be indexed in the search
engine. You can also select if the attribute is required or not. Additionally some datatypes have aditional
settings, like default value and max string length for text line.
</p>

<p>
For our car class we will create datatypes of "Text line", "XML text" and image.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Name: Text line</li>
<li>Manufacturer: Text line</li>
<li>Model: Text line</li>
<li>Year: Text line</li>
<li>Description: XML text</li>
<li>Image: Image</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now that we've created all our attributes we can just click on the store button and our class is ready to use.
</p>

<h2>Creating content</h2>

<p>
To take our newly created class for a spin we click on the content menu in the administration interface. You then
browse to a suitable placement and select "New car". This will bring us to the object edit window shown below. Here
you fill in all the values you want for you car and click "Send for publishing".
</p>

<img src="/doc/images/object_edit.jpg" alt="Object edit" border="1" />

<p>
Now we've already published our own custom content without changing any code just clicking in the web interface.
When we view our newly created it will display with the standard templates as shown below:
</p>

<img src="/doc/images/object_view_plain.jpg" alt="Object view standard" border="1" />

<h2>Custom template</h2>

<p>
The standard template is not how we want our car to be displayed at our webpage. Now we need to get our hands dirty, and create
a display template. To create a specific we need to figure out the ID of our class. The ID is a unique number which
represents our class. This can be found in the class list under "Set up -> classes". In my case this was 26.
</p>

<p>
To make eZ publish understand that you want to have a custom template for your newly created class you must
create an override template for this. You can do this by creating a file in the eZ publish root. The eZ publish
root is the main folder of your eZ publish installation. There you will see the sub folders, lib, kernel, design etc.
The file should be created under the design folder:
</p>
<pre class="example">
Unix:
design/standard/override/templates/node/view/full_class_26.tpl
Windows:
design\standard\override\templates\node\view\full_class_26.tpl
</pre>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> If you don't have the subfolders override/templates/node/view, these must be created under your design folder
( which is design/standard/ as default ).
</p>

<p>
This file is a plain text file which you can edit with your favourite text editor, e.g. vi, emacs and notepad.
It must be a plain text editor with no formatting, so you cannot use word processors like word or open office.
</p>

<p>
Replace standard with your current design folder and 26 with the ID of your class.
</p>

<p>
This .tpl file is a eZ publish 3 template file and is a combination of XHTML and
eZ template syntax. The example below shows a simple customisation where we place the
attributes in a table and have a large image under the page title.
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;h1&gt;{$node.name}&lt;/h1&gt;

{attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.image}

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    Manufacturer:
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.manufacturer}
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    Model:
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.model}
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    Year:
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    {attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.year}
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

{attribute_view_gui attribute=$node.object.data_map.description}
</pre>

<p>
In the example above you see that we use the template variable {$node} whenever we want
to fetch some data from our object. The node represents the specific placement of our object.
E.g. if it's published under /frontpage/news/ that will be a node. We can fetch the
object name using {$node.name}. This is the automatically generated name for the object which
we configured to be equal to the attribute: name. The function {attribute_view_gui } is a template
function used for fetching the content of a specific attribute. You use the attribute identifier
to specify the attribute.
</p>

<p>
The image below shows our car using the custom template.
