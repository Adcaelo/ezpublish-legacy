<h1>Subversion</h1>
<p>
Subversion is the system we use for version control for eZ publish. It's similar to CVS
but has some differences which make it a better version control system. A brief
explanation of the usage will be given, for more detailed information visit it's
homepage.
</p>

<h2>Checking out</h2>
<p>
Checking out a copy of eZ publish is done by invoking the command:
<pre class="example">
svn co <i>uri</i>

for instance

svn co <i>http://zev.ez.no/svn/nextgen/trunk</i> -d nextgen
</pre>
Using the <i>-d</i> option will allow you to change the created directory to something different
than the one you're checking out.

The checkout command will ask you for a username and password, you should however be aware
that the earliest versions of subversion stores your password in cleartext on the checked out
version. This will however change in newer version of subversion.
</p>

<h2>Checking for local changes</h2>
<p>
Whenever you've done some changes locally you can get an overview of
it by running the <i>status</i> command.
<pre class="example">
svn status

or

svn st
</pre>
It will then list all files which are modified, added, removed or not present in the repository.
This is done without asking the repository server since subversion keeps a copy of the original
file locally.

If you want to figure out changes done on the repository you run the same command with the
<i>-u</i> option.
<pre class="example">
svn st -u
</pre>
</p>
