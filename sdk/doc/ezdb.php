eZ db is a database abstraction library. It provides a uniform interface
to MySQL and PostgreSQL.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>

To make the it easier to support the different databases we've defined a subset

</p>

<ul>
<li>int - integers, date and time as UNIX timestamp, enums and boolean</li>
<li>float - float and prices</li>
<li>varchar - short text strings ( < 255 chars )</li>
<li>text - large text objects like article contents</li>
</ul>
