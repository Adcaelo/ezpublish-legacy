<h1>Shopping cart</h1>
<p>
The default action on products is to assign the product to the current user. The cart can
contain as many products as the user wants to buy. The cart is session based and can not be
shared between different computers. The cart does not require the user to log in before it's
used.
</p>

<p>
Each item you store in the cart has the following attributes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Content object/product</li>
	<li>Unit price</li>
	<li>Count</li>
	<li>VAT</li>
	<li>Sub total</li>
</ul>

<p>
The cart will also calculate the total price for the product. VAT will be
calculated on a pr item basis and as a total for the whole cart. Shipping
cost will be calculated, this will however only show the default shipping. The user
can decide to change the shipping type in the checkout.
</p>

<p>
The diagram below shows the different states of the cart.
