<h2>Passwords</h2>
<p>
Storing passwords should be done by creating a non-revertible hashed version of it. A very
good method for creating hashed versions is to use the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html">MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm</a>.
The password is fed to the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.md5.php">md5 function</a> with the username and a unique
id for the site. This ensures that two users with the same password cannot be spotted in the DB tables, not even
across sites.*
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure that the supplied username and password are sent using <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">SSL</a> when submitting a form. Otherwise
it's possible to sniff the traffic of a site and fetch the username/password.
</p>

<p class="footnote">* If users are to be shared across multiple sites, the site id must be supplied on all sites.</p>
<h3>MD5 example</h3>
<pre class="example"><? print( eZTextTool::highlightHTML(
'function createHash( $user, $password, $siteid )
{
    return md5( "$user\n$password\n$siteid" );
}

function authenticateHash( $user, $password, $siteid, $stored_hash )
{
    return createHash( $user, $password, $siteid ) == $stored_hash;
}
'
) );?>
</pre>

<h2>Form tickets</h2>
<p>
To avoid Client side Trojans all forms must use a system called <i>tickets</i>. A
ticket is unique key which is created dynamicly for a given action. The ticket is created
on the server when a form is created and stored in a database as well as placed in the
form as a hidden variable. When the user submits the form data the code fetches the ticket
and authenticates it against the stored ticket in the DB table. If the ticket is valid
the action is performed and the ticket removed, if not a warning message is printed to
user telling him that he's probably been tricked by a Trojan.
</p>
<p>
Tickets can also be used to help with double-click problems from forms. When the code
starts a check for the ticket is done, if it exists it is locked in some way and code
continues. If the user then double-clicks and the code is restarted it will see that
the ticket exists but is locked and thus shows a page explaining that the a double-click
was detected.
</p>

<h3>Ticket creation</h3>
<pre class="example"><? print( eZTextTool::highlightHTML(
'$ticket = eZTicket::createFor( "myaction" );

$tpl->setVariable( "ticket", "myaction-$ticket" );

$tpl->display( "myaction.tpl" );

// myaction.tpl
&lt;input type="hidden" name="ticket" value="{$ticket}"/&gt;'
) );?>
</pre>

<h3>Ticket validation</h3>
<pre class="example"><? print( eZTextTool::highlightHTML(
'$ticket = eZHTTPTool::postVariable( "ticket" );
if ( eZTicket::validate( "myaction", $ticket ) )
{
    eZTicket::destroy( "myaction", $ticket );
    ... // action!
}
else
{
    $tpl->display( "warning.tpl" );
}
'
) );?>
</pre>

<h2>Input validation</h2>
<p>
All input from the user should be validated before storing them. For instance when expecting
integer or date data always check to see if it is actually the wanted type, if not
issue a warning to the user. The input may then be converted to a more reasonable state, for instance
dates should be converted to integers, but do not perform any escaping of text or similar an text washing.*
When the input is valid and in a acceptable form store it as it is.
</p>

<h3>Reasons for not escaping input data</h3>
<ul>
<li>The data may not only be used for HTML output but may be sent to other clients which require them in their original form.</li>
<li>There's no way to know if the data is escaped or not after it has been saved, this means that inputting data from other sources than HTML needs escaping as well.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example"><? print( eZTextTool::highlightHTML(
'$date = eZHTTPTool::postVariable( "Date" );
$date_obj = new eZDate( $date );
$date_num = $date_obj->value(); // Returns integer value
'
) );?>
</pre>

<h2>Output washing</h2>
<p>
Before displaying stored data in a HTML page must make sure that it's presentable, especially
to avoid cross-site scripting (XSS). This might mean
escaping the data or converting to a different form, however this washing must not be done until
the data is just about to be shown to the user. This means that the code for escaping must not be
placed in the class or function which returns the input data but rather in the template code, this
because it's not known what the client code wants to do with the data.
</p>

<pre class="example"><? print( eZTextTool::highlightHTML(
'$obj = new eZObject( $id );

$tpl->setVariable( "obj", $obj );
$tpl->display( "view.tpl" );
// view.tpl
{$obj.title|escape}
{$obj.description|escape}
{$obj.price}
'
) );?>
</pre>
