<h3>{$result_number}. Missing zlib extension</h3>
<p>
 The zlib extension is not available to eZ publish.
 Without it eZ publish will not be able to install the demo data, however if you do not
 wish the demo data you can safely ignore this.
</p>
<p>
 To enable zlib you need to recompile PHP with support for it. You will need to configure PHP <tt class="option">--with-zlib[=DIR]</tt>.
 More information on that subject is available at <a target="_other" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.zlib.php">php.net</a>.
