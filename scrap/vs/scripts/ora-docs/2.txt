I have PDF files stored in Oracle BLOBs but can't seem to find a way with PHP3/OCI8 to get one out of the blob and write as a PDF file. Any help?

I haven't tried it but you can perhaps test this code portion to output 
a pdf file on the browser

header("Content-type: application/pdf");
$conn = OCILogon("user","passwd","ORACLE_INSTANCE");
$recherche="select pdf_field from table where unique_clause";
$stmt = OCIParse($conn,$recherche);
ociexecute($stmt);
$ok=OCIFetchInto($stmt,&$data,OCI_ASSOC);
echo($data[ "PDF_FIELD" ]);
