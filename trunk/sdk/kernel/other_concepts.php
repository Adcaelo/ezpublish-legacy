<h1>Other concepts</h1>

<h2>Information collector</h2>
<p>
In the class edit you can mark attributes as information collectors. This means that
they can be used to get information from the user. Not all data types can be used as
information collectors. Information collector will primarily be used for handling forms
and polls, but may be extended to handle other information collections as well.
See the <a href="/sdk/tutorials/view/forms">Creating forms</a> tutorial for an example.
</p>

<h2>Object version</h2>
<p>
Every content object consists of one or more versions. These versions contain the content
data for the content object. Only one version of an object can be considered published,
this is called the current version. Each version may belong to a different user.
</p>

<h2>Object translation</h2>
<p>
Every content object consists of minimum one version with one translation.
You can have as many translations of the content object as you like.
