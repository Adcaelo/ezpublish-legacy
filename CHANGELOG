# v1.0  29 Sept 2009

* added FAQ and CHANGELOG
* Moved [eZJSCore]Packer=disabled from site.ini to ezjscore.ini to comply with eZ Network certification


# v1.0rc2  19 Sept 2009

* added link to project website in ezinfo page
* Don't store $moduleResult['content_info']['persistent_variable'] unless it's already defined (to avoid confusing code that checks for presence of $moduleResult['content_info'])
* flatten persistent_variable array to make sure array_unique can actually remove all duplicates
* Fixed: Access to a kernel module via index_ajax.php
* Fixed: don't write persistent_variable back in pagelayout.
  Changed to write it back to module_result.content_info, as not writing changes back cause more damage then do writing the changes back.
* Added note in ezinfo about jQuery
* Fixed url to jQuery to use google cdn and not googlecode
