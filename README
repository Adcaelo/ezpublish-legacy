eZ Online Editor 5.x extension README


What is eZ Online Editor 5.x?
============================

   eZ Online Editor 5.x (ezoe) is a eZ Publish extension that customizes
   eZ XML datatype (the "Rich text" datatype) with a wysiwyg editor (TinyMCE based).

   ezoe provides a user friendly interface for editing eZ XML, it does not change the
   fact that eZ XML is a xml format (XHTML 2.0 inspired) that by default enforces*
   strict separation between content and design. Thus all features of TinyMCE not supported
   by eZ XML is disabled and not supported (supported plugins/buttons are listed in ezoe.ini).

   * This enables enterprise features like pr tag template view, multi channel publishing,
     clean content export and places design control in the hands of designers and not editors.
