template_tests
--------------

The template_tests compare the results from the templates run with the new template 
engine with an expected output. In the directory template_tests and subdirectories are 
the test-files located with the following extensions:

:*.in:   The input template file written in the ezcTemplate syntax. 
:*.send: A PHP file that returns a hash (array) with mapped variable names and values. 
:*.out:  The expected output when the *.in (and *.send) are run.
:*.tpl:  The old template language. When the *.out file is not present, it will run the old 
         template engine, together with the *.send file.
