eZ Online Editor MCE extension 5.0 FAQ

1. eZ Online Editor MCE is not activated in eZ Publish
==================================================

You will need to check if the extension is properly activated in site.ini.
Open 'settings/override/site.ini.append(.php)' and find the 'ExtensionSettings'
section. Under it you should have an entry that says:

ActiveExtensions[]=ezoe

Make sure there are no spaces before or after the name.

You should also consider checking the debug output of eZ Publish to see what is
going wrong.


2. After installation, I only get Disable editor/Enable editor button when
   editing an article, no any other changes.
==========================================================================

A. Make sure you have correct apache rewrite rule. Have you restarted apache
   after changes?

   Look in INSTALL file, under #4 for more information on rewrite rules needed.

B. Make sure you are using one of the following web browsers: 
   Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher,
   Mozilla 1.8 or higher,
   Firefox 1.5 or higher,
   Netscape 9.0 or higher.
   Safari 3.0 or higher.
   Opera 9.5 or higher.
     
   (It is always recommended to use the latest stable version of the browser)
   
   Make sure that Javascript support is enabled in your web browser.

   Note: Safari and Opera is not well tested at this time, so if you experience
         problems or unexpected result. Please try again in Firefox or Internet
         Explorer and report the issue to us so we can fix it!



3. After installation, I see nothing have been changed when editing an article.
===============================================================================

A. Check your installation path. The correct path should like following:
   eZ Publish Root - kernel
                   - lib
                   - doc
                   - bin
                   - design
                   - ...
                   - extension - ezoe - modules
                                         - design
                                         - ezxmltext
                                         - settings
                                         - ...
B. Have you changed  ActiveExtensions[] to ActiveExtensions[]=ezoe
   in site.ini?

C. Make sure you have cleared all the caches (both eZ Publish and browser).


4. When I insert an image into the editor, it does not show the image.
===============================================================================

Check the 'extension/ezoe/settings/site.ini.append.php' file, find line

ImageClassIdentifiers[]=your_image_class_identifier

under [MediaClassSettings]. Is the image class identifier correct?


5. When I insert an image into the editor, it disappears after storing.
=======================================================================

Are you trying to insert image right before or after heading?
Note that images/objects can't be saved in the same line as heading.

Make sure you have permission to store the image in the placement you choose!
Make sure the upload limit of the image size is set high enough both in php settings,
apache settings and on the image class in eZ Publish ( it is 2Mb by default )


6. I click right mouse button on the selection, but see no 'Properties' there.
==============================================================================

This feature is removed to allow users to use the browsers built in spell checker.
Click on the tag name in the 'Path:' to edit the tag properties or on the glowing
button (if there is a button specifically for the tag you have selected)!


7. Some popup dialogs does not work (merge cells / html source / color picker )
==============================================================================

These popup dialogs requires that html/htm files are allowed to be loaded from design
folder. ( more specifically design/javscript/ )
Take a look at you apache rewrite rules to make sure they are not rewritten by apache.
