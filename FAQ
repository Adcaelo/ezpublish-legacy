Q: I just pasted in some javascript in my template, and suddenly nothing is
   shown correctly. What happened?

A: This is because our template engine treat the { and } characters as special
   characters and expects template specific code. You need to use the {literal}
   function to make sure the javascripts are parsed correctly. Place {literal}
   before the javascripts and {/literal} after.
