Known bugs in eZ publish 3.0
----------------------------


Versioning
----------
Object relations are lost when reverting to another version of the object.

Search
------
Too many database calls when indexing objects. Need to find the unique words
in PHP so that we will only index unique words.

זרו caracters do not work properly, we must also test russian and chinese. 
Probably the same error there.

Translate
---------
Complex data types, e.g. image, does not work when translating.

Translated objects are not indexed in search.


Validate
-------
Images are not uploaded if some attributes does not validate

View object with temporary class will show double of all attributes in list.
Due to temporary version of class which is joined in SQL.

Enum datatype
-------------
It does not work to edit enum datatypes when there exists a temporary version
of the class.
