<p>
	There are basically four ways of installing eZ publish 3. You can use one of the
	supplied installer packages, which will install Apache, PHP, MySQL, ImageMagick and set up
	everything needed to get eZ publish up and running. Another option is to use the
	eZ publish sources and follow the setup wizard which will guide you through the
	steps of configuring your system for eZ publish.

	If you are little more experienced you can disable the setup wizard and
	configure eZ publish 3 from scratch following the installation manual. If you
	don't want to install eZ publish 3 yourself you can always hire eZ systems to
	install the software for you. You can also buy a ready hosted eZ publish 3 solution.
</p>

<p>
	The installers are designed as a quick way to get eZ publish up and running for testing purposes.
    If you plan on using eZ publish for more than just testing, we recommend you install it manually,
    either by letting the setup guide do the configuration or by configuring eZ publish by hand.
